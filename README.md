# RMS-Copypasta-Generator
A GNU/Linux copypasta generator written in GTK#

Generates the "**I'd like to interject for a moment**..." copypasta with your own texts (for example: Linux/GNU instead of GNU/Linux)
# How to use it
- First of all: make sure you have Mono & GTK# installed on your computer (https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/)
- Second: double click on the file or compile it with MonoDevelop (It shouldn't give you any warning or error)
- Third: generate your copypasta
